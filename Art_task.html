<h1> Here is a task recommended for you:</h1>
<h3> This is a task that is related to the whole LibreHealth organization.</h3>
<p> Your task is to create a new logo or slogan for the organization and create artwork around it. Later you have to submit it on the LibreHealth Forums. The task would be very meaningful if you researched about LibreHealth before actually creating the artwork.</p>
