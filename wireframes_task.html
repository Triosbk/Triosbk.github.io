<h1>Here is a task recommended for you:</h1>
<h3>This is a task related to LibreHealth EHR, which is an application used as an electronic health record by health care professionals. </h3>
<p> For this task, you will have a chance to explore the health record application and then create wireframes using websites like <a href="https://www.figma.com/">figma.com</a> to help the user have a better experience while using the application. Later you can submit your wireframes with a small description about what you created in the LibreHealth forums.</p>
